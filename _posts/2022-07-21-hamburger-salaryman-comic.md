This is a 4 page comic that was originally in Swamp Cone Magazine #5. I'm uploading it <a href="https://freedrull.itch.io/hamburger-salaryman-comic" target="_blank">as a pdf on itch.io</a> now, so anyone can read it. Hope that's ok!

The story is about working on your side project during your lunch break, and trying to find meaning in that even though you might never see success or even finish it.

Hope you like it!
