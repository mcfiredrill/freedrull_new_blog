Heard Oven was leaving Philly, so I knew this was the last chance to eat some tomato pie together in the city of love.
Out of desparation I took work off and bought a ticket for the weekend.

The Philly's chunked it hard, but it was more than worth it to watch the Phanatic pie a fake opera singer and get some crab fries
with the homie.

We did a b2b in Oven's philly studio, catch the whole video here.
