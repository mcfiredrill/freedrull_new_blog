The Euljio/Jonglo area is one of the most interesting places in Seoul. You can find virtually any kind of hardware, printing, or textiles you ever need, with many old specialist shops. Walk around and you'll pass a shop that is only selling LEDs, another one specializing in toilets, another one with many kinds of lamps, etc. Unfortunately as what usually happens, this area is set to be demolished and replaced with high rise apartments, apparentally.

Yesterday there was one protest against this where one of my favorite DJs in Seoul, Seesea was DJing on the back of a truck circling Euljiro/Jonglo! So I decided to check it out.
