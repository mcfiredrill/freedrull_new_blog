<a href="https://www.instagram.com/s_u_m_o_r_a_i/" target="_blank">Sumorai</a> is a producer from Sweden. He released some tracks on two previous
datafruits compilations. We decided to re-release those tracks with some
remixes, along with two new originals by myself.

One is a house number with some hideous attempts at scatting.

The other is a sort of breaks filled jungle romp using the acapella from the Buck
Bumble N64 game. Sumorai did a great remix of this one.

Hope you enjoy these!
