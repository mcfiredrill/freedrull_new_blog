Had a good time going back to Tokyo for the first time in many years.
Lots of shows played with ksd and friends.

Also got to check out "the pool", a CD shop with a back room full of un-organized
boxes of CDs. The system requires a reservation but basically you are free to dig
and buy any CDs you find in "the pool", given you help pack up some boxes of loose CDs. They give you gloves!
