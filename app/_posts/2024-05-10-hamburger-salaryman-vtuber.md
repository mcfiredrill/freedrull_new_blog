After an attempt to create my own simple 2d vtubing app, I began to investigate other solutions.

I came across vpupper which claimed to work on linux.

Since I already had a hamburger salaryman model exported and somewhat working in vrchat, I was able to use the rigged glb file in vpuppr.

For face tracking I found that meowface can be installed on android. I can run this on my phone, attach the phone to a goose neck on top of my monitor. The phone sends the face tracking data over the local network, and vpuppr recieves it.

This works alright except I have to ensure that the phone's battery doesn't die, also often times android will nag for updates, interrupting meowface. So I'd like to find a webcam based solution instead.

I stream pretty often on twitch.tv/freedrull\_ , mostly working on burgerzone deluxe meal or datafruits.

Unfortunately it doesn't seem like vpuppr or meowface are being maintained anymore. Perhaps I can create my own simple vtubing app in godot someday, and find another tracking solution (openseeface seems viable).

Come stop by the stream sometime I am working on lots of funny redeems, and you can trigger sound effects to annoy me while I'm trying to concentrate.
