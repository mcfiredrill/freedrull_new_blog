We're holding International DJ Supermarket vol. 2 this Saturday June 15th at Channel 1969 in Seoul.
Its our first time organizing an event at 1969. I designed the flyer together with Kiki.

I'm always glad <a href="">Seesea</a> agrees to play our events, still one of my favorite DJs in Seoul. Should go well with our new all-ponchak live
set for <a href="https://soundcloud.com/wificellphonekidz">Wificellphonekidz</a>.
<a href="">Mikkotraz</a> is in Seoul during this time, so I asked him to play. He's a juke/footwork producer
from Helsinki, Finland. <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/mitsuko-endo/">Mitsuco</a> is also coming from Tokyo. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/2shy2dj">DJ Fart in the club</a>, originally from Seoul now living in Berlin is going to b2b with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/2x292st5/would-u-help-me-find-this-wallet-lost-around-karlmax-and-schonstedtstrase-before-recording-this-mix">DJ Netto 3000</a>, as well as <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jorengthericecake">Jorengthericecake</a>. On visuals we have <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sewingbug_/">Sewingbugstudio</a>, from Seoul now based in Krakow, Poland. So I guess the event is really "international" this time hehe.

I'll play some kind of vinyl set consisting of the old Korean records I found on a recent trip to Busan, and some house/italo/acid stuff.
